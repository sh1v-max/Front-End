# Z-Index in CSS

> The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

> An element with a higher z-index is always in front of an element with a lower z-index.

> Z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).

- It is used to control the order of overlapping elements.
- Default value of z-index is `auto`.
- The z-index property can take any integer value (positive, negative or zero).
- The z-index property can also take the value `inherit`.
