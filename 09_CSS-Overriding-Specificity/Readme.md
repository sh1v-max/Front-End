1. Specificity order : inline css > id > class > element
- Inline style overwrite every property expect the property on which !important is there.

2. !important - overwrite all the property.

- How to overwrite !important ?: It can be overwrite by !important only. (by cascade rule) or by increasing the specificity.

NOTE : Refrain from using inline & !important.
