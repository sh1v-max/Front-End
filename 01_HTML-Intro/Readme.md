# HTML

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

### Basic HTML code

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

>The above code is a basic structure of an HTML page. Let me explain it:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that this document is an HTML5 document
- `<html>` is the root element of an HTML page
- `<head>` contains meta information about the HTML page
- `<title>` specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
- `<body>` defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- `<h1>` defines a large heading
- `<p>` defines a paragraph
