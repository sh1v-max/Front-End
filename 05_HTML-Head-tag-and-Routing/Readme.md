# Head Tag and Routing in HTML

## Head tag

The `<head>` tag is used to contain metadata about a document, such as its title, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and other metadata. It is placed between the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

## Routing in HTML

The `<head>` tag is also used for routing in HTML. Routing is a way to map URLs to specific pages or actions in an application. It is commonly used in web applications to map URLs to specific pages or actions.

The most common use of the `<head>` tag for routing is to specify the URL of a page. This is done using the `<base>` tag, which specifies the base URL of a page. The `<base>` tag is used in conjunction with the `<a>` tag to specify the URL of a page.

## Linking different pages in Body tag

```CSS
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <a href="/about.html">About us</a>
    <a href="/contact.html">About us</a>
    <a href="/frontend.html">Frontend</a>
</body>
```
